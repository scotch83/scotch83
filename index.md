I am **Mattia Collalti** a **Senior Software Developer** working remotely with **{{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:2015 }} years and more of experience** in international environments and with the most modern **Agile** methodologies!
I like to define me rather as a modern artisan, hence the web page name

I am mainly focused on üßëüèª‚Äçüíª **front-end, mobile development and team leading**, with technologies such as **Angular, Ionic** and **Xamarin**, as
my main expertise, but I also have an extensive knowledge suitable in positions as frontend developer using frameworks as **React.js** - or fullstack techs like **Node.js and Express.js**, or even **.NET**.

My hobbies are music and **sailing** _‚õµÔ∏è_ <img align="right" class="sailing-img" style="margin: 0 20px" height="150" src="/assets/images/prodiere.jpeg">

This makes me a **great team player**, always able to _coordinate and deliver work succesfully_, **helping my colleagues** when needed!
